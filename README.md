## Steps (developpement mode)

### 1 - Setup a PostgreSQL database

You will have to create a PostgreSQL database needed for the project to run. Informations like database name, root and root password will be used to fill the configuration file.

### 2 - Setup `.env` file

You will have to complete or custom the env file to make the project work on your own system. If not in the root folder, you must create a file named `.env`.

The default content:

    DB_NAME="" #default HealthP2
    DB_USERNAME=""
    DB_PASSWORD=""
    DB_HOST="localhost" #localhost for local project
    PORT="2000"
    BCRYPT_SALT=10
    SUPPORT_EMAIL=""     # Email adress to send
                         # activation & stuffs mail
    SUPPORT_EMAIL_PASS=""  # Pass generated by 
                           # (if using Gmail) to be used in app

These variables are not meant to be null or empty
